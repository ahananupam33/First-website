    <h1 class="text-center">Football</h1>
    <p><em>This is my first blog so after thinking long and hard, I decided to write about football because I had to choose something that goes in my list of favourite stuff,
    so here goes and I hope you guys enjoy reading it</em>.</p>

    <h2>What is it?</h2>
    <p>The first question in almost every blog,topic that needs to be answered!!!</p>
    <p>Well in short, football is one of the <strong>most popular and exciting sport</strong> on the planet today. The <em>football fever</em> as it is called, has spread all over the world.
    From children playing with flimsy balls on the streets to professional players honing their skills on the pitch, the love and passion for the game is the same. Other than the traditional 11 
    players-a-side format, football has various other forms like <em>beach football, futsal, street football, etc</em>. </p>
    <p>The first football league was established way back in <strong>1888 in England</strong>. Nowadays, we have over a <strong>1000 leagues</strong> all over the world of which around 200 have been given official recognition 
    by <strong>FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association)</strong> which is the international governing body of association football. Popular leagues like the Premier League, La 
    Liga, and others generate huge revenues through high views and sponsorships. Clubs like <strong>FC Barcelona, Real Madrid, Manchester United and others</strong> have huge fan following all over the world 
    <em>including me (a Barca fan)</em>. This has given an opportunity to many to earn their livelihood while doing what they love.</p>

    <h2>How is it played?</h2>
    <p><em>I won't delve too much into the details because this is a blog not a book</em>. Essentially as compared to many other sports where you need expensive equipment to get going, you don't need 
    anything expensive for football. The basic stuff needed are <em>a ball, two pairs of goalposts (it can even be <strong>two bricks</strong>), a suitably playable ground and some friends</em> 
    to get going. The aim is to score more goals than your opponents within a stipulated time. A goal is scored when the ball is kicked or headed into the opponent's goal. The team with the most
    goals after the stipulated time wins the game.</p>
    <p>In professional games, this stipulated time is <strong>90 minutes</strong> with an <strong>extra 30 minutes</strong> in case both sides have the same goals after 90 minutes. If the game is still undecided, the game is 
    decided on <em>penalties</em>, where both sides get <strong>5 shots on goal from 12 yards out</strong>. The team with most penalties converted wins. If both sides have same conversions, then the game heads to sudden death
    where both teams keep taking penalties until one team misses.</p>
